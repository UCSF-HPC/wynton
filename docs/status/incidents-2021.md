#### <span style="color: orange;">Server room maintenance</span>

**Notice**: The air conditioning system in one of our server rooms will be upgraded on January 28.  The compute nodes in this room will be powered down during the upgrade resulting in fewer compute nodes being available on the cluster.  Starting 14 days prior to this date, compute nodes in this room will only accept jobs that will finish in time.
