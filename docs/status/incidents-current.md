### January 29-February 12, 2021

#### <span style="color: orange;">Kernel maintenance</span>

**Notice**: New operating-system kernels are deployed. Compute nodes will no longer accept new jobs until they have been rebooted. A node will be rebooted as soon as any existing jobs have completed, which may take up to two weeks (maximum runtime). During this update period, there will be fewer than usual slots available on the queues. To follow the progress, see the green 'Available CPU cores' curve (target ~10,400 cores) in the graph above.  Login, data-transfer, and development nodes will be rebooted at 13:00 on Monday February 1.

### January 28, 2021

#### <span style="color: orange;">Server room maintenance</span>

**Notice**: The air conditioning system in one of our server rooms will be upgraded on January 28.  The compute nodes in this room will be powered down during the upgrade resulting in fewer compute nodes being available on the cluster.  Starting 14 days prior to this date, compute nodes in this room will only accept jobs that will finish in time.
